SyncPlay.NET is a C# client for the [SyncPlay](https://github.com/Syncplay/syncplay) protocol with a user interface made from WPF. As for the compatible players, currently only VLC media player is compatible. As for the interface between SyncPlay.NET and VLC media player, the command line remote control is used. 

> **Warning :** Please note that SyncPlay.NET should be used with caution because it cannot be guaranteed to work as well as the original client written by the SyncPlay team. Another thing to note is that this requires .NET Framework 4.7 or newer
